            At Firebase Subscription Hub, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not "sell" your personal information in the traditional sense, such as exchanging it for monetary compensation.

            However, under certain privacy laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) / California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), the term "sell" can also include sharing personal information with third parties for non-monetary benefits, such as for cross-context behavioral advertising or certain types of analytics.
